how to encapsulate:
* include CSS as well? needs to come from the app ...

more:
* use modules

notes on react:
* props: immutable, owned by the parent component, passed down to children
* state: mutable, owned by the component itself

TODO:
* isInteger(3.4) b04k
* parameterize upper-casing -- maybe a cleanerizer callback??
* dropdown options in JS?
* show/hide weirdness
