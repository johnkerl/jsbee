app:
* current/next semantics for mode button (vs hide/show button)
* local-storage memory for bee/pattern mode, and word-list selection -- and hey probably minmax as well

how to encapsulate:
* include CSS as well? needs to come from the app ...

more:
* the .maroon business has always been weird
  o relates to CSS-specification improvement ..
* use modules

notes on react:
* props: immutable, owned by the parent component, passed down to children
* state: mutable, owned by the component itself

sliver:
* props to ctors (e.g. button colors)

TODO:
* isInteger(3.4) b04k
* parameterize upper-casing -- maybe a cleanerizer callback??
* dropdown options in JS?
* lots of assertions
* better way to surface errors
