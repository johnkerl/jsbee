TO DO:
* Bee-mode/private-mode two-button selector (much more intuitive)
* Local-storage memory for bee/pattern mode, and word-list selection -- and hey probably minmax as well
* CSS/props in Sliver -- button colors, at minimum
* The .maroon business has always been weird
* Use modules
* Parameterize upper-casing -- maybe a cleanerizer callback??
* Lots of assertions
* Better way to surface errors
