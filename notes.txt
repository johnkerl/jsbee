maybe classes:
* input text
* integer range w/ protected input
* min/max coupled range
* buttons

parents/mixins:
* reset/clear pattern
* example/A-Z pattern
* maybe a base class -- ? for style.display etc?
  o but this is redundant w/ respect to the browser model -- keep it transparent
  o base elementID & obj?

how to encapsulate:
* ctor w/ form id -- where to insert
  o min/default/max -- ctor args here too
* reset methods
* delegate event-listeners
* attr-getters for avoiding duplication into app state
* include CSS as well? needs to come from the app ...

app level:
* make the app a class? w/ its state?
* setState method -- ?

notes on react:
* props: immutable, owned by the parent component, passed down to children
* state: mutable, owned by the component itself
