app:
* mwords as card somehow ... hidden/switch ...

how to encapsulate:
* include CSS as well? needs to come from the app ...

more:
* the .maroon business has always been weird
  o relates to CSS-specification improvement ..
* use modules

notes on react:
* props: immutable, owned by the parent component, passed down to children
* state: mutable, owned by the component itself

sliver:
* package w/ readme etc
* props to ctors (e.g. button colors)
* example app

TODO:
* isInteger(3.4) b04k
* parameterize upper-casing -- maybe a cleanerizer callback??
* dropdown options in JS?
