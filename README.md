# jsbee

A quick little JavaScript app for (last-hope-desperation!!) peeking into pangram puzzles including the NYT Spelling Bee.

Features:

* Enter 0 or more required letters. (For the NYT Spelling Bee, there is one center letter.)
* Enter 0 or more other letters. (For the NYT Spelling Bee, there are six other letters.)
* If you enter letters only in the required-letters field, you get more of an anagram finder
* Choose the word list from the dropdown
  * "Usual suspects" is a short, curated list of once-bitten-twice-shy values from previous Bees.
  * "Long list" is a long list (almost 200K words), not all of which are in the NYT Spelling Bee. That is, this can show words that the NYT Spelling Bee doesn't accept.
